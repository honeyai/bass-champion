This is my Mod 1 project, Bass Champion!

Technologies Used: This game was made using mostly CSS and HTML with a bit of Javascript. I used keyframe animations for all of the green timing circles and positioned everything exactly where I wanted it to be with CSS. 

Approach Taken: I worked from the CSS/visuals to the code, so basically from the outside to the inside. I did it this way because it seemed like the easiest way for me to eventually test my code and animation timing. I figure if the beats are off, at least it will look cool. From there, I looked for ways to repeat animations to make it simpler to time the notes with each song. I did not find a way to do this, so instead I decided to use mutliple timing circle images so that I could "edit" the timing of the beats for each note. 

Installation Instructions: 

Unsolved Problems: I originally wanted to have the player choose the song they wanted to play on the Song Selection screen, but I remembered that HTML pages can't exchange information with one another, so the song selection screen is pretty much just for previews of the songs and aesthetics now. I was also having a tough time trying to think of an efficient way for the game to register two correct key presses that occur at the same time, but I realized I did't have enough time to implement and test a method for that; instead I just have the note timings always at least slightly out of sync with one another.
