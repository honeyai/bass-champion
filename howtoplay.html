    <div class="playInstructions">
        <p id="premise">You are an up-and-coming bass player and you’ve found a Battle of the Basses! In this game, you’ll compete against another player (the computer) to see who can do a better job playing the cover song.</p>
        <p id="instructions">When you see the green circle around each note, hit the button that plays that note on your keyboard (see Controls).  If you reach a combo of 40 notes in a row, you can turn on STAR POWER for a x2 multiplier. If your accuracy dips below 60%, the crowd will boo you off stage. So do your best!</p>
